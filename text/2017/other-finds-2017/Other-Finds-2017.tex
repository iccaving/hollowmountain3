				Codeine, codeine, codeine, codeine!
				
				
				I’m begging of you take away my pain\\
				Codeine, codeine,codeine, codeine!\\
				Please just numb this feeling in my brain.
				
				
				As a powder you’re beyond compare\\
				Effervescing when there’s water there\\
				Your bubbles rising, bursting with a gleam
				
				
				In tablet form you taste so sweet\\
				Though I really shouldn’t eat you neat\\
				But I cannot resist your lure codeine
				
				
				\emph{(chorus)}
				
				
				The constant ache within my bones\\
				The bruises which induce my moans\\
				You take it all away from me codeine.
				
				
				Every day and every night\\
				I cannot live without the sight\\
				or smell or taste or feel of you codeine.
				
				
				But my prescriptions running low\\
				Just fourteen packets left to go,\\
				Two sheets per pack right now, then let me see…
				
				
				There’s eight of you sealed in a sheet\\
				That’s 2-2-4 left for this week\\
				And then I’m on my own again codei … ne
