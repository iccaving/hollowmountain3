\chapter{2015 - Povodni Mo\v{z}}
		\lettrine{W}{ith} 2.2\,km discovered in \passage{Vrtnarija}, all below 600 m, \emph{Povodni Mo\v{z} 2015} was another successful year of deep pushing. Significant work went into the extensions off \passage{Sic Semper Tyrannis} which led to the closure of an 840\,m loop in the south, while \passage{Colarado Duck} was passed with a further 270\,m of passage found beyond. Aven climbing at \passage{Strap on the Nitro} enabled the discovery of 294\,m of south trending passage heading towards \passage{Wonderstuff} in the `\passage{Old System}'. 

		For the first time in \passage{Migovec} exploration two underground camps were operational at the same time: camp \passage{X-Ray} at -650\,m, a 4 berth camp set up in a central position, and camp\passage{Deep Core II} at -850\,m near \passage{Red Cow}, a 2 berth camp set up by divers Jarvist Frost and Connor Roe for future use as access to the \passage{Watership Down} sump, and used this year by them as a staging post for the northern extensions. Camp \passage{X-Ray} remained the main exploration camp. All leads however were then more than 2.5 hours away, raising the possibility of setting up another camp, closer to the southern leads in \passage{Sic Semper Tyrannis}.
