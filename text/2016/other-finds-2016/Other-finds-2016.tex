\section{Additional findings around Migovec}

\subsection{The Auld Alliance}
William French and William Scott embarked on a journey to the \passage{Monatip}-\passage{NCB} connection passages, intent on dropping a rope down one of the several ongoing leads in the '\passage[|see{Vsporedni Svet}]{Avenue of Pitches}'. They entered via M2 to reach the \passage{NCB} section of the cave and, navigating their way from boulder choke to boulder choke entered the continuation of the horizontal passage. Although they had rope and bolts, they only managed to reach a ledge 15m down on a large pitch, reported to be going big. This pitch is not far above the old system's \passage{Level 2}, whose large piercing shafts had required many infamous traverses to overcome, and could drop through the roof of one of the numerous avens.

\subsection{The Stile, Cattlegrid}
Early on the expedition, Rhys Tyers noted a couple of muddy crawls leading off the bottom of Knot Very Good pitch. Over the course of several trips, the Cattlegrid passage was explored to a wet 10m pitch and a small maze of low phreatic crawl-ways connected to Smer0 via the Stile. The tubes had been rejuvenated by two vadose steams whose stepped descent provided a relatively easy access to the pushing front. After a couple of visits however, the mud which had lain undisturbed for tens of thousands of years in neat little alcoves was liberally plastered over white walls.

\subsection{B9 - Jackie's blower revisited (aka the Eyrie)}
Arun Paul chanced upon the large entrance of B9 near the western edge of the Plateau, and almost due west of the Bivi. Discovered in 1994 and revisited on a number of occasions since, the cave provided a gentle introduction to expedition caving. Rhys Tyers led a bolting trip there to push the bottom pitch, as well as rig the 'Moon Door' a rift heading out of the cliff face and providing a airy view of the Tolminka valley below.
