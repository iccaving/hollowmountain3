Pushed \passage{Brezno Slapov}, which had been discovered by Jana Čarga and Iztok Možir the year before, last night, it was a great trip!

Dropped a couple of pitches to get to a canyon/rift with a stream, followed it and eventually got to a sump. But taking a left turn down and inlet leads to the base of another wet pitch and a continuation of passage, but is was wet and we didn't go on. \name{Clare Tan}

\recipecorner{The Slop}{ The slop is the evening meal. \begin{citemize} \item It generally takes the form of a stew accompanied by rice/grains/pasta/couscous. \item Usually, there is protein/carbs in the stew as well as the accompanying dish. \item It starts with starting soaking any pulses and dried veg (including dried mushrooms) after breakfast/lunch in water with the contents of flavour sachets added.  \item The favour sachet selected determines the type of slop and what other ingredients might go with it. \end{citemize}}

Exciting night of pushing yesterday. \passage{Clapton} pitch is a massive space. Effectively like two shafts right next to each other. We drop the shorter one. Couple of leads at the bottom. One has a bedding plane squeeze that stopped Maffi, it follows water to a small pitch, might join up with something off the other half of \passage{Clapton}.
We mainly pushed the other lead, schematic on facing page. It's still open and going.Unfortunatley when we started to survey we discovered a crack in the clino glass. Which is why the tentative passage name is now \passage{Crack Shack} [ed. not on page reads `Renamed \passage{Pick Your Poison}]. There's also alot of black sandy silt deposition in our passage, plus its in keeping with the cocaine theme...
Going back today to survey waiting for day trainers to arrive, listening to music, writing this to put off pissing....I really like caving and camping underground...
P.S. none of the leads were killed during this push!!!!

\subsection{07/08/2013}
Went back to \passage{Clapton} yesterday to survey what we found the previous trip ~200m added to this years total. There are so many leads there we called it \passage{Pick Your Poison}. Will be dreaming about it now for the next 11 months...
I guess this is now my last few hours in camp. It's been a great expo of caving for me - many thanks to all my pushing/camping partners: Saber, Izi, Rhys and Maffi for the excellent trips and company. Thanks also to all who have camped at \passage{X-Ray} for the laughs and great conversation.
Almost can't believe another expo is drawing to a close...caving-wise I feel thoroughly satiated, but I've enjoyed myself so much that I don't want it to end. Ah well, there's always next year, and the year after, and the year after....I wonder if I'll still be here in 10 years?
I should really go to sleep but my body doesn't want to cooperate....Maybe it's time to read Tetley's 15 page epic (from earlier in the expo). \name{Clare Tan}

\vspace{2.5ex}
Still no inspiration, I guess Clare Tan has drained out of me even this, nor only all energy, while trying to figure out how to squeeze through those passages we've found. Anyway it is the last day in \passage{X-Ray} this year. Wish this refuge was open the whole year. Aja! I want to thank Dave Wilson for the hint on \passage{Balamory}. He made possible the biggest discovery this year! And with this he also gave Erik and me the sensation of pioneers. Thanks Dave! (well this sensation we get every time we push something nice but this one could be compared with findings of Columbus, Marco Polo, Juri Gagarin :) ) Thank you Erik, thank you Clare Tan. Thank you everyone that made \passage{Mig} adventures possible. Over an out.
