\section{A rather cold welcome}

When Rhys Tyers and Clare Tan flew out a week before the main 2014 expedition, they had no inkling that the \passage{Hollow Mountain} reserved a rather unpleasant welcome for them both, for after a long ascent through dwarf pine they broke onto a bleak landscape. The sun had not started to pierce through the shifting cloud cover, giving the place a desolate, empty look. Less empty however was the \passage{Bivi} shakehole: \bignote{a large snow plug occupied the space which was to be filled with the buzz and bustle of excitement only a score of like-minded explorers can produce}.

This was rather problematic since it kept the \passage{Bivi} temperature far below that the \passage{Plateau}. At the best of times, the bivi shakehole is a couple of degrees cooler than elsewhere, now it was practically freezing. It also prevented the access to the stone circle, rendered the usual washing space impracticable and finally because the melt runoff produced a most repugnant mixture.

As the main core of the expedition arrived however, large numbers of helping hands, adequate job division and most of all, a determination to vanquish the uninvited iceberg saw a large operation of snow removal take place. Some was hauled out of the shakehole and dumped into \passage{M10} --- maybe a fraction resisted further melting and was later hauled up for drinking water the following year--- another portion sawed off and sculpted and one particularly large lump provided shelf space for the drying dishes and cutlery.

Little by little, the ice receded and the cold \passage{Bivi} nights turned more pleasant, even as news of further underground discoveries came floating back across the \passage{Plateau}. The weather improved gradually, and it was not without a pinch of sadness that we saw the last of the snow melting in between the scree under a hot summer's afternoon.
