\chapter{2014 - Zkozi Zrcalo}
		\lettrine{I}{n} many ways the 2014 expedition adopted the previous four years' format. The total duration was set at 5 weeks, between 11th of July and 14th August and in total 22 cavers made their pilgrimage to the Hollow Mountain, staying anywhere between 1 and 5 weeks.

Camp \passage{X-Ray} in \passage{Friendship Gallery} was the chosen base for deep exploration. Most of the new passages visited this year were found south of \passage{Atlantis} and left as an expanding network of passages with many questions unanswered. The discovery of a large chamber and an active stream below made for a hydrological puzzle.

		Hardy cavers were lured towards the deep end, where, after the discovery of the large series of rifts below \passage{Balamory}, they headed down a winding stream passage until they encountered the water table at \passage[sump]{AJA!?} sump (-963\,m).  Due to the distance from camp and elusive nature of the remaining 2013 pushing fronts, the feeling that some of the leads might be out of reach of the more novice cavers spread among expedition members. In the end however, the discovery of 1.2\,km of cave, all of it at depths greater than 500\,m and sometimes as far as 3\,hrs from the camp, involved all the \emph{Zkozi Zrcalo} expedition novices and dispelled any qualms about the accessibility of the pushing fronts.

 		The noteworthy visit to \passage[duck]{Colarado Sump} a decade after its original discovery yielded, on top of its more obvious rerigging and rebolting by-products, an unexpected result: the previously `terminal looking' sump revealed to be a mere duck. Jarvist Frost also put significant effort in laying the foundations for a deep, lightweight underground camp near \passage[camp]{Red Cow} with sights on \passage{Watership Down} (-972\,m), to this day the deepest point in the entire \passage{System}.
