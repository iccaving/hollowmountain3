\section{A visit to the Southern Reaches via Stuck in Paradise}

\subsection{Overview} 
Cavers undertaking a trip to \passage{Atlantis} and beyond will visit one of the only locations where abundant and large stalactites/stalagmites are found in \passage{Sistem Migovec}. As well as long and arduous horizontal passages, the trip involves a memorable muddy pitch, a large chamber with interesting sediment and the chance to witness biological remains of trogloxenes.

\subsection{Friendship Gallery to Hidden Surprise}
From camp \passage{X-Ray}, it is necessary to go along \passage{Friendship Gallery} back to the bottom of \passage{Zimmer} pitch and ascend the rope to the \passage{Cheetah} window, climbing into the cleft several rebelays until the passage levels off and slopes towards a pitch head. A careful descent of the \passage{Cheetah} pitch lands on a ledge, 5\,m from the boulder strewn floor proper. The way to \passage{Hidden Surprise} is on the right hand opening, up into a large trunk passage. A muddy descent leads to a small, roped drop onto a perpendicular, but still large passageway. On the far side, a hidden squeeze through boulders (paper note towards \passage{Red Baron}) leads to a short crawl over loose blades of rock to the next pitch.

\subsection{Hidden Surprise to Red Baron traverse}
At the bottom, the way on is again through boulders, and slightly up to the \passage{Milka Pitch}: a rope on the right-hand side leads to a tight rebelay and a traverse to the right before a final section of descent on the opposite wall, which lands on a pile of boulders. A short, roped drop through boulders and a wriggle leads to the key breakthrough of \passage{Kamikaze}. 

\textit{At the PSS, the upwind continuation eventually leads to \passage{Kamikaze} and the \passage{A Pun Too Far} streamway}. 

Downwind ends at a boulder collapse  \passage{Red Baron} chamber, sloping towards the right to a pit. The namesake traverse goes over the pit.

\subsection{Red Baron traverse to Stuck in Paradise}
On the other side of the traverse, an ascending tunnel, the \passage{Throne Room} enlarges at an up- climb, past one rebelay to \passage{Amazing Grace}, another trunk route. The way goes past some larger collapse chambers before a marked up junction where one climbs down to a boulder choke. Following the draught through the boulders and keeping high and left in the following, sloping chamber, one eventually emerges into the start of \passage{Puff the Magic Dragon}, the continuation of the trunk route. Past two handline climbs down, the passage terminates at the start of \passage{Stuck in Paradise} pitch.

\subsection{Stuck in Paradise to Sic Semper Tyrannis}
The abseil route spirals down the shaft, which is broken in several sections. Finally, a constriction through boulders leads to the final deviated rope and a landing at \passage{Hawaii} junction, where a daren drum full of collected drips offers the only available water between \passage{Zimmer} and \passage{Brezno Slapov}. What follows is a low ceiling, but mainly walking passage heading south, interrupted by a short perpendicular climb where wall crystals are particularly prominent. After a lowering to a hands and knees crawl, a short wriggle through a boulder choke leads to the start of \passage{Atlantis}, which is the continuation of the abandoned phreatic tube. About 600\,m of varied crawling to walking passage, hosting many decorations  where the way on is always south, past the \passage{Minestrone} and \passage{We're Not Alone} junctions. Towards then end, the passage slopes down to a boulder junction where the sound a waterfall from \passage{Brezno Slapov} can be heard. 

\subsection{Sic Semper Tyrannis to First Draft}
A the junction, the start of \passage{Sic Semper Tyrannis} is a squeeze over a flat boulder to a cobble-floored alcove and and the start of a multilevel rift. Bearing left, a couple of traverses over pits leads to a T junction. 

\textit{Right leads to the start of \passage{Pleasure Palace}, via a 10m pitch, which eventually reconnects to the \passage{Meridian Way} via a 300\,m crawl. Beyond the pitch lies a boulder chamber with several ways on, including a climb to \passage{Helm's Deep} chamber or down to the streamway and \passage{Davy Jones' Locker}. The water eventually cascades down to the \passage{Lethe} streamway.}

Left is the way on, up into a multilevel rift heading south, \passage{Jericho}. A short climb can be bypassed by a narrow squeeze, which lead on to a further ascent and descent into \passage{Squidgy Goodness}. The remnants of a dormouse can be found at the bottom of small 2\,m climb down. Further on, \passage{Jetstream}, so named because of the chilling strong draught takes the shape of rift with wide ledges where it is necessary to climb up to a muddy squeeze and slope down to a boulder choke. Past the boulders is the start of \passage{Final Draft}.

\subsection{Final Draft to Choke-a-Bloke}
At the next junction, turning left past some decorated alcoves and crawling through white sand pools quickly leads to the start of a slanting pitch. 25\,m below, the pitch enlarges as it meets an abandoned phreatic passage. North connects to the \passage{Pleasure Palace}. South is the \passage{Meridian Way}, 150\,m of easy walking passage past some dormouse excrement, hair and bones to a boulder choke. The passage continues beyond to a junction. The obvious continuation drops down to the south west, ending after 100\,m at a boulder choke and an unclimbed aven (\passage{Empty Quarter}). Back at the junction, a too tight squeeze marks the end of \passage{Choke-a-Bloke} and the end of this trip. This passage lies about 350\,m away from mountain side.
